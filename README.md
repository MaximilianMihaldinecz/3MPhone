3MPhone
=======

Simple phone book application to aid learning of: C#, Windows Forms, .NET framework, FileStream and basics of object orientation.

/* Thanks for checking out this code. I hope you will find it usefull. 
* The key idea is to keep it simple, just functional. The program is for "teaching" purposes, not really for real-life use.
* There are tons of things you can improve... e.g. data validation for user input and file management.
* 
* You can find the license in a seperate file, it is GPLv2. You can use it accordingly in your work.
